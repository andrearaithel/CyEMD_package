# CyEMD: A differential analysis method developed for CyTOF data
The CyEMD R package provides a differential analysis method that is based on calculating the Earth MoverÂ´s 
Distance between expression distributions. It can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

## Installation
Currently the package is only available on GitHub. For installation use one of the following possibilities:

1. The package can be directly installed from GitHub running
   
   ```remotes::install_github("https://github.com/biomedbigdata/CyEMD_package.git")```

2. The package can be installed after cloning the repository running

   ```devtools::install("~/path/to/package")```
